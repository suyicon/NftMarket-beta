We propose the design and implementation of an IPFS-based NFT trading platform for large-capacity digital collections to address this problem. The system uses the truffle framework to write and deploy smart contracts, and deploys the contracts on the Ganache test blockchain, which ensures the security and stability of the smart contracts and provides users with a reliable transaction guarantee, and uses web3.js to allow users to interact with the contracts through front-end pages in order to achieve a convenient and efficient user experience. The data of user collections will be stored in the IPFS system, using decentralized storage, trustworthy, secure and efficient, providing users with a one-stop digital collection storage and trading service.

## Getting Started

First, run the project:

```bash
npm run nft-market
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
